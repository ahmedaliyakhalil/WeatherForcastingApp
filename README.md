# WeatherForcastingApp
CodeAlpha task 3



This project is a great way to level up your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
skills to create a fully functional weather app that allows users to
search for weather conditions and forecast information in any location
around the world.
To do this, youâ€™ll be integrating with a weather API like
OpenWeatherMap and then polling this service to fetch and display
data within your app. API integration is a foundational skill for web dev
pros, making this project a great way for you to hone these skills.
You can also get to grips with Bootstrap to style a responsive app
front-end that looks great on any device.
